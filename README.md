# slackplan

SlackPlan is an open source system for calculating the optimal slack of submarine fiber-optic cables, as well as the route to follow on surface for a correct positioning on seabed. It uses the latest theoretical advancements on the subject. 

SlackPlan is entirely hosted on GitHub. If you are a company that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies for the lay of submarine cables, consider joining the project and contributing.
